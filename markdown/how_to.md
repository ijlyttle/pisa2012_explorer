This app was built as part of an entry to the [@useR! 2014 Data Visualization Contest](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/datavisualizationcontest.htm), based on OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012.

Please be patient, it takes a few seconds to build the plots. If the app crashes, please reload and try again.

In exploring the data, you have a choice among different estimates of student proficiency in the **subjects** of math, reading, or science.

You may also choose to examine the correlation of proficiency with a", variety of factors concerning the student's home, focusing on posessions. Two such factors are chosen: an **outer factor**, shown using the white violin-plots, **inner factor**, shown using the blue-colored box-plots.
            
One of these factors is chosen for the **correlation** used to group the countries.
